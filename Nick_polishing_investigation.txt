Polishing is a key part of assembly accuracy. 


Currently we have a pipeline that assesses 5 assemblers, of those 3 are pretty decent. 
Flye, Raven and Unicycler. 


We have WGA data for 10 strains, this is unreasonable to expect users to have but is it helpful in polishing.


The native data is of variable quality 


Polishes include Racon, Pilon, Medaka 


Typically polishing approaches use a combination of these, and a combination of short and long reads. 


We currently use Racon x 4 (Long reads) , Pilon (Short reads) , Racon (short reads) 
There are other options out there. 
We are also testing Racon x 4 + Medaka and Racon x4 + Medaka + Pilon 


We can assess assembly quality from polishing using Short ORFs and Breseq pipeline for Deletion and SNPs (using Illumina reads) 




Things we want to know: 


Do novel reads improve polishing? (ie reads not used for the assembly) 
How many rounds of Racon are actually needed? 
Does the quality of Nanopore reads significantly affect polishing? 
Does the quality of Illumina reads significantly affect polishing? 
Does WGA data help polishing?
Is there an optimal polishing pipeline? 
Is there an optimal polishing/assembler combination?  




How do I see you doing this? 


We have an assembly pipeline, you could use as a starting point and build branches into this that will take the assemblies at various parts of the polishing pipeline and run metrics on them. 


First steps! 


Take a look at the snakemake as it already is and the tools/assemblers used


Have a think about different polishing options / Pipeline options that will answer some of the questions above
